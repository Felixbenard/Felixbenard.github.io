  <h2>HTML Semantic Elements</h2>
  <p>
    Semantic elements clearly describe their meaning to both the browser
    and the developer. Examples include header, nav, section, article, and footer.

  <p>
    Using semantic HTML improves accessibility, SEO, and code readability.
    This is highly tested in exams and required in professional projects.
